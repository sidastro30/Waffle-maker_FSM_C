Modelling the behaviour of the system using Extended Finite State Machine (EFSM)
C code implementation with arbitrary inputs

Description: Waffle Maker

A waffle maker that has independently controlled top and bottom plates. A temperature
sensor for each plate provides their temperatures as integers, tempTop and temp Bottom.
Each plate is controlled with pure outputs TopHeatOn, TopHeatOff, BottomHeatOn,
BottomHeatOff.
 •A plate must be turned on if its temperature drops below 275°F
 •A plate must be turned off if its temperature exceeds 325°F
 •Assume that the temperature increments or decrements 1°F at a time
